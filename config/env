# Repository password saved in the macOS KeyChain.
# To use restic from the terminal and cron, you have to add the password to both login and System keychains:
# 1. Add the password to the login keychain: `security add-generic-password -s restic-repository-pw -a restic -w`
# 2. Copy it from the login keychain to the System keychain (right-click copy in login → right-click paste in System).
export RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND='security find-generic-password -a restic -s restic-repository-pw -w';

# On Linux you save your password to `~/.config/restickler/restic-repository-pw` (`chmod 640 …`) and
# set RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND to 'cat ~/.config/restickler/restic-repository-pw'.
# You may also use the RESTIC_PASSWORD variable, but this is less secure, because exported variables
# containing credentials may be revealed accidentally.
