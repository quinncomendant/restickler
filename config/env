# To use restic from the terminal and cron, you have to add the password to both login and System keychains:
# 1. Add the password to the login keychain: `security add-generic-password -a restic -s restic-repo-pw -w`
# 2. Copy it from the login keychain to the System keychain (right-click copy in login → right-click paste in System).

#export RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND="cat $HOME/.config/restickler/restic-repo-pw";
# You may also use the RESTIC_PASSWORD variable, but this is less secure, because exported variables
# containing credentials may be revealed accidentally.
